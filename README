## Preserving symlinks

It may be required to use preserve symlinks for some programs to work properly. For e.g with typescript you may need to pass the
`--preserveSymlink` flag or with node `--preserve-symlinks` && `preserve-symlinks-main`.

For executing symlink binaries, `lpm` automatically changes the source file to have these preserve links flags so you don't have to worry about that. But for cases for external tools like `typescript`, you need to manually pass these flags.

Common programs with preserve flag

`node --preserve-symlinks --preserve-symlinks-main ...`
`npx tsc --preserveSymlinks ...`
